Companion Object Bootcamp is your source of knowledge about mobile DevOps for Android. While features are crucial to any app's success and popularity, there are many other aspects of mobile app development which despite being as important, are often neglected.

Some of the reasons for such status quo may be explained by technical debt, limited resources, and complexity of Android tooling ecosystem.
